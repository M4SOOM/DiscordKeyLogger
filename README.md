# DiscordKeyLogger
A Discord keylogger is a type of malware that can be used to steal Discord users' keystrokes. This can include their usernames, passwords, and other sensitive information. Keyloggers are often installed on computers without the user's knowledge, and they can be difficult to detect. This Keylogger is designed to run in the background without being detected by the user. It creates no such log files on the system which can make it difficult for antivirus software to find them. Once installed, this keylogger can begin recording the user's keystrokes and sending them to the attacker via Discord Webhook URL specified in the Python Code.
