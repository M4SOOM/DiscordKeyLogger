## About The Project

A Discord keylogger is a type of malware that can be used to steal Discord users' keystrokes. This can include their usernames, passwords, and other sensitive information. Keyloggers are often installed on computers without the user's knowledge, and they can be difficult to detect. Once installed, this keylogger can begin recording the user's keystrokes and sending them to the attacker via Discord Webhook URL specified in the Python Code.
